For this project, I built a Task Management Dashboard using React and TailwindCSS, following the Kanban-style board layout with three columns:

To Do

In Progress

Done

Tasks can be:

Viewed (fetched from mock API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)

Created (via a form at the top)

Dragged and dropped between columns to change status.

I used @hello-pangea/dnd for drag-and-drop support and made sure the project is fully responsive for both desktop and mobile devices.
API integration was simulated by fetching from the mock API and updating the local state accordingly.

I am satisfied with the overall structure, UI cleanliness, and responsiveness.
However, API update (PATCH) operations after drag-and-drop are only simulated locally (not persisted on the server).

While the project covers all the core functionalities (view, add, move tasks), I recognize some areas where the implementation could have been better:

No Real API Update: After moving tasks across columns, the updated task status is not truly updated on the backend because JSONPlaceholder API is read-only for updates. Ideally, this would involve a real PUT/PATCH request.
If I had more time, I would:

Implement Full CRUD with a Local Mock Server: Set up json-server locally to properly POST, PATCH, and DELETE tasks in real time.
